# Discussion forum web-app
> App created for the course Databases and web-development course at University of Helsinki, using Python, Flask and PSQL.

## Intro
Web-app will be a familiar messaging board/ discussion forum, where users can post **messages** in different **topics** and **threads**, as well as create new topics and threads to discuss about.
The idea is a slightly modified version of the *"Discussion app"* example idea from the course page.

## Features
- Users can log in and out
- Users can create new account to login with
- Users can see and interract with topics that are shown on the homepage of the application
- Users can see when the last message was sent in each topic, as well as how many threads are under the topic
- Users can create new *topics*
- Users can create new *threads* under the topics 
- Users can send a new *message* under existing threads
- Users can create and modify a user profile page
- Adminis can add and remove messages, threads and topics
- Adminis can create a ban users

Inital plan has 6 database tables, this may increase during the project

## Notes
- goal is to get this project done quick, thus unlikely I will incorporate any extra features or a fancy interface.
- features as well as database tables are subject to change during the project
